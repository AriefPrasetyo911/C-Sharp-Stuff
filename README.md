# C-Stuff
After some 6 months of doing VBA, PHP, Python and jQuery I think it is a good idea to go back to the roots again. Let's see what will come up.

# C# Debugging Shortcuts:

<pre>
- F5              Run
- F10	            Step Over. Does not step into the current method and advances Visual Studio to the next statement.
- F11	            Step Into. Advanced to the next statement unless it is a method call in which it drops inside for line-by-line.
- Ctrl + F5	      Runs the project without debugging.
- Shift + F11	    Step Out. Completes and steps out of the current method.
- Shift + F5	    Stop. Debugging stops and returns Visual Studio to design mode.
